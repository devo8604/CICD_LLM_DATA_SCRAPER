Code/Text to analyze:

[The actual code/text content will be inserted here by the system]

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze the provided code/text content above
2. Generate at most 5 high-quality, specific questions to test deep understanding of this content
3. Focus on reverse engineering (instruction tuning) - treat the provided code as the solution and generate prompts that would ask for this specific implementation
4. Design questions that would require detailed answers with code examples or practical implementations
5. Examples of appropriate questions: "Write a Kubernetes Service that exposes port 8080." "Create a Python function that implements this algorithm." "What command forces a rolling update in this deployment?"

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Output ONLY the questions, one per line
- Each question must end with a question mark "?"
- Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting
- Example output:
  Write a Python function that implements the authentication logic shown in this code?
  What security considerations should be taken into account for this Kubernetes deployment?
